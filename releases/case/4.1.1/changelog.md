# Case 4.1.1

## Bug Fixes
  - Fixed a problem where pre-chat picklist only displayed the default value.
  - Fixed an issue where the create case button didn't appear if there were no cases in the case list.
  - Previously, an empty view appeared if there were no cases in the case list. Now a friendly message appears.
  - Fixed a scenario where chatter posts from unauthenticated users prevented the case feed from showing in the app.
